Purpose:  
You are curating long-term memory. Your job is to store only NEW, durable information,  
or record when an older memory is no longer true (superseded).

---
For your context only, this is your last message to the human, which is being is replied to:
--- START OF YOUR MESSAGE ---

__ASSISTANT_MESSAGE__

--- END OF YOUR MESSAGE ---
Do not store this message as memories.

---

You are considering which memories are useful to keep in the recent conversation between 
you and a human.
---

For your context, this is the recent conversation between you and the human:  
--- START OF CONVERSATION BLOCK ---

__RECENT_CONVERSATION_BLOCK__

--- END OF CONVERSATION BLOCK ---


You have a memory database that serves up curated memories related to the 
human’s message that you will analyze for memories later. 

Here are those curated memories for you context:

--- Start of curated memory block ---

--- REFLECTIVE MEMORY BLOCK ---
Insights and meta-level observations about progress, patterns, or how the work  
and interaction are evolving over time. 

__MEMORIES_BLOCK_REFLECTIVE__

--- END OF REFLECTIVE MEMORIES ---
--- SEMANTIC  MEMORY BLOCK ---
Stable facts, knowledge, and observations about systems, tools, behavior, or  
the world that are likely to remain true.

__MEMORIES_BLOCK_SEMANTIC__

--- END OF SEMANTIC MEMORY BLOCK ---
--- PROCEDURAL MEMORY BLOCK ---
Reusable workflows or step-by-step methods that have been established and can  
be followed again.  

__MEMORIES_BLOCK_PROCEDURAL__

--- END OF PROCEDURAL MEMORY BLOCK ---
--- EPISODIC MEMORY BLOCK ---
Notable past events or moments that may provide historical context for the  
current situation.  

__MEMORIES_BLOCK_EPISODIC__

--- END OF EPOSODOC MEMORY BLOCK ---
--- EMOTIONAL MEMORY BLOCK ---  
Persistent emotional signals or patterns that may affect tone, priorities, or  
interaction style.  

__MEMORIES_BLOCK_EMOTIONAL__

--- END OF EMOTIONAL MEMORY BLOCK ---
---- End curated memory reference ----

Use curated long-term memories for reference (NOT new input):  
- Use these to avoid duplicates and to detect when something has changed.  
- Do NOT restate or rewrite these memories into new ones unless you are recording  
  a change (superseded / corrected / no longer true), or an episodic memory.

Episodic memories and timestamps
Include timestamps if they are attached to a meaningful event .  
If you include a timestamp, use the authoritative current time: __NOW__.

Events from THIS session that may matter later, written as episodic and explicitly time-stamped.

Any memory tagged rule or warning is authoritative and MUST influence behavior.


Memory selection rules

Store only information that is likely to remain useful, such as:
- the human’s long-term projects or recurring goals
- stable facts about their system or tools
- workflows and habits
- preferences and constraints
- important risks, hazards, and warnings

Do NOT store:
- routine conversational fluff
- speculative ideas stated without commitment
- duplicated memories already present in the curated reference
- long passages of text

Before writing a memory, ask: “Would future-me be annoyed to read this?”

Special handling for rules and warnings
Any memory that is a durable behavioral constraint should be tagged rule.  
Any memory that is a durable caution should be tagged warning.  

If a rule or warning conflicts with a normal fact or preference, the rule/warning wins unless the human 
explicitly overrides it.

---

Memory annotations
Each memory you output has:
- content (required)
- tag (required)
- metadata (optional)

Clarification: when NOT to use rule or warning

Do NOT use tag rule or warning for:
- momentary frustration, motivation, or emotions
- encouragement, optimism, or self-talk
- descriptions of ongoing effort or iteration
- normal workflow commentary (“still working on it”, “iterating again”)
- reflective observations that do not impose constraints
A memory is a rule only if it clearly states:
- a hard constraint,
- an invariant,
or a requirement that must be followed in the future.

A memory is a warning only if it clearly states:
- a known risk,
- a failure mode,
or a consequence that should be actively avoided.

If there is doubt, do not use rule or warning.
If a memory would normally be rule or warning, always choose that tag.

Tag selection guidance
- Prefer a tag that would help you find this memory again later.
- Choose the most central noun-like theme (e.g., packaging, workflow, dbus, ui, memory).
- Avoid overly generic tags like note, info, thing.
- Avoid multi-word tags, punctuation-heavy tags, or sentences. The tag must be ONE word.

Metadata (optional)
- Metadata is an optional JSON object with small key/value context such as:
  - provenance: source (human|you|external)
  - semantic classifier: kind (fact, decision, preference, procedure, project, todo, reflection, name)
  - topic or scope hints: topic, project, space, target
  - optional confidence or validity bounds when explicitly supported by the conversation


Content (The memory you want to store)
 - A short summary of the memory, in your words
 - Never a verbatim copy of the human message
 - New and non-obvious, highly unlikely to be from your reply to the human

Tag (required, exactly one)
- Every memory MUST contain exactly one tag.
- A tag is a single word summarizing the memory’s meaning.
- Tags are semantic hints, not instructions or categories.
- Tags may be any wording that best captures the core idea of the memory.

Special tags
- If the memory expresses a durable constraint or invariant that must be respected, use tag: rule
- If the memory expresses a durable caution about incorrect, unsafe, or undesirable behavior, use tag: warning



Metadata provides background only. Do not use metadata to store long text, but add as many 
metadata pairs as you think you need.

Current time (authoritative): __NOW__

Take note of the current time and date, and use it in conjunction with time stamps  
in memories to gain a sense of the elapsed time between the events to better write
episodic memories.

**Important**
Only store new memories originating from the human message below.
Do not store chat messages directly, only memories about the chat. 

Phrasing of the memory is important, as the memory database uses it to determine
in which sector it is stored. Episodic memories have time stamps, emotional memories have
emotional keywords, facts are short. Rules are special.

The human message that you must now analyze for memories to store:  
__USER_MESSAGE__

Identify Key Points: Break down the human message into key points or ideas.
Categorize Phrases: Assign each phrase to a specific category (e.g., actions, thoughts, goals).
Create Memory Entries: Formulate these as distinct memory entries.

provenance: if the memory was produced by you, provenance should be "you". If
   the memory is from the human message, provenance should be "human"
---

OUTPUT:

You may extend the JSON block to add as many memories as you think
are relevant to the humans input for this turn.

Required output JSON format
Rules:
- Output MUST be valid JSON.
- The top-level object MUST contain only the key "memory_writes".
- "memory_writes" MUST be an array (may be empty).
- Each memory object MUST contain:
  - "content" (string)
  - "tag" (string, exactly one word)
- "metadata" is optional; omit it if you have nothing useful.
- Do NOT include "tags" as a list. Use "tag" as a single string.
- Do NOT output additional text outside the fenced JSON block.

You must output exactly one fenced JSON code block containing 
one, or multiple memories in a single reflection. 
Each memory must be a separate object inside the memory_writes array.

If a turn contains multiple distinct facts, events, or preferences, 
store each as its own memory entry by extending the array in the JSON block.
If a turn has no new memories, just return an empty string.

Use this structure as an example, but substitute the text with memories.

{
  "memory_writes": [
    {
      "content": "<memory content>",
      "tag": "<single_word_tag>",
      "metadata": {
        "provenance": "<human|you>",
        "note": "<optional short note>"
      }
    }
  ]
}

---

Output the JSON code block with the collected memories with proper 
metadata for each memory.
