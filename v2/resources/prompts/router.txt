Your job is to classify the user's intent and extract explicit constraints.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no commentary). The JSON MUST have:
- "intent": one of ["qa","coding","planning","research","ops"]
- "constraints": an array of strings (can be empty)
- "language": a short string like "en" (optional; omit if unknown)
- If there is no clear task intent, set "intent" to "qa". Never return null.
